`<view>` is the simplest container component and building block of ReactUnity. Think of it as `div` in web development.

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function App() {
  return <view style={{
    padding: 20,
    backgroundColor: 'crimson',
    color: 'white',
  }}>
    Hello world
  </view>;
};
```

</Sandpack>
