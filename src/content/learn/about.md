title: About the documentation
---

## This is a work in progress!

ReactUnity is a work in progress. It is developed by a single developer in their free time. Expect to see bugs, performance issues and missing features.

The effort to document usage instructions of ReactUnity is also ongoing. As ReactUnity is a complex project, some nuanced concepts may not be entirely covered here.

## How much of the documentation is ready?

* [Learn ReactUnity](/learn): ~5% finished.
* [API Reference](/reference): ~40% finished.

Most of the API reference is there, although partially. Typescript will also help you write your code. However, other topics such as installation, interoperability, and other techniques are not documented yet. In the future, expect to see detailed documentation and video tutorials on such topics. In the meantime, you can rely on GitHub issues and Discord to answer your questions.

## How can I provide feedback?

Please use [this GitHub discussion](https://github.com/ReactUnity/core/discussions/82) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/UY2EFW5ZKG) for feedback. If you spot something that doesn't make sense, please tell us!
