## What is ReactUnity?

ReactUnity is a framework that lets you code UI using React and show it inside Unity.

ReactUnity is not a hack or a workaround. It is a legitimate way to use React. React framework is built in a way so that the React logic can be used in different platforms. In fact, all platforms which can run Javascript can have a framework like ReactUnity.

In Web development, it is ReactDOM. In native mobile (and desktop) applications, it is React Native. And in Unity, it is ReactUnity. There are actually more [Awesome React Renderers](https://github.com/chentsulin/awesome-react-renderer) you probably haven't heard of.
